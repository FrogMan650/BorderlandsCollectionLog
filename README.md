# Borderlands Collection Log
A desktop app for collecting unique items in borderlands games.<br>
Items can be filtered by type of item, rarity, game, and whether you've obtained it or not.<br><br>
__11-8-25 Pre-Release__<br>
* All Unique/Legendary/Seraph/etc. items added from Borderlands 1, 2, TPS, and 3.<br>
* Borderlands 4 items will be added when there's better concrete information available for them.<br>
* Filtering and display is fully functional with custom built code to load and unload cards as you scroll to massively save on performance.<br>
* Hunt score has also been added to any item that has one from past hunts.<br>
* There currently is nothing built to keep track or display hunt score or total items collected, but will be added soon.<br>
* The obtained/unobtained button also works and will actively filter items as you mark them collected or not collected with the appropriate filters selected.<br>
* Tooltips to be added for each source to show location and chance.<br>
  * This functionality is present on just a few items in this build such as Ajax's Spear or Avenger; both from Borderlands 1.
