# Borderlands Collection Log
A Windows app for collecting unique items in all Borderlands games.<br>
Items can be filtered by various criteria such as type of item, rarity, game, and whether you've obtained it or not.<br><br>
__12-1-25 1.0 Release__<br>
* All known items from Borderlands 1, 2, TPS, 3, and 4 are included.
* Custom images have been made for every item type based primarily on the item icons from Borderlands 2.
* Tooltips have been added to item source to show where the source is located in the game and the drop chance from that course, if known.
* Every item now includes a direct link to the items page on the Borderlands wiki and Lootlemon.
* A settings menu has been added for various different settings.
   * Settings to change which games items contribute to the item counts on the banner at the top.
   * Hunt Mode: This causes only items worth hunt points to be shown and the sources on the item cards better reflect The Hunt rules.
   * Hide Unobtainables: This setting will filter out items that were only available during limited time events or are only from DLC.
   * Save Reset: This will reset all items to an unobtained state.
